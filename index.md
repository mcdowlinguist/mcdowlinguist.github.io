Here you'll find information about me, my research and various projects, as well as the occasional blog post. 

I'm a linguist working in Montr√©al with a specialization in experimental phonology, and I am also currently one of the co-editors of the [Revue canadienne de linguistique/Canadian Journal of Linguistics](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/canadian-journal-of-linguistics-revue-canadienne-de-linguistique).

This website is based on Paul Le's [academic template](https://github.com/LeNPaul/academic) (with personal modifications to make it bilingual).
